Here is the SSH command you need to connect to your server.

PowerShell

ssh -i "C:\Users\kyle\miso-factory-repo\pem\MISO-Forge-Key.pem" ec2-user@44.197.204.43
## How to Use
Open your terminal (like PowerShell or Command Prompt).

Copy the command above, paste it into the terminal, and press Enter.

Note: The username ec2-user is the default for Amazon Linux servers. If your server is running Ubuntu, the username will likely be ubuntu instead.

This error confirms that your EC2 server is running out of disk space when it tries to build the Docker image.

The workflow is correctly connecting to your server, but the cleanup commands are not working as expected, causing the server's storage to fill up.

## Your Next Step
To solve this, you must run the diagnostic commands directly on your server. This is the only way to see why the build is failing.

Connect to your server using the command from our last step:

PowerShell

ssh -i "C:\Users\kyle\miso-factory-repo\pem\MISO-Forge-Key.pem" ec2-user@44.197.204.43
Once you are connected, run these commands one by one:

Bash

# Check the server's disk space
df -h

# Navigate to your project folder
cd ~/miso-factory-repo

# Update the code to the latest version
git fetch --all
git reset --hard origin/main

# Manually try to remove the large data directory
echo "Attempting to remove model data..."
rm -rf python_agent_runner/ollama_data
echo "Removal command finished."

# Try to run the build manually
sudo /usr/local/bin/docker-compose up --build -d
Please paste the entire output from your terminal after you run these commands. The output will show us exactly what is happening on the server and lead to the final fix.







too big to paste



Show thinking
No problem, that's common when a Docker build fails. You don't need to send the entire output.

We just need two key pieces of information: the server's disk space and the final error from the build.

## Getting the Essential Info
Please SSH into your server again and run the following commands.

First, run the disk space command and copy its output:

Bash

df -h
Next, run the build command again, but this time, save the output to a log file:

Bash

# This will run the build and redirect all output into build_log.txt
sudo /usr/local/bin/docker-compose up --build -d > build_log.txt 2>&1
Finally, display only the last 50 lines of that log file and copy the output:

Bash

tail -n 50 build_log.txt
Please paste the output from the df -h command and the tail -n 50 build_log.txt command. Those two pieces will be small enough to paste and will tell us exactly what we need to know.

tmpfs           1.6G     0  1.6G   0% /run/user/1000




Show thinking
This output confirms the root cause of all the failures: your server's hard drive is almost full.

The key line is:
/dev/nvme0n1p1   30G   28G  2.5G  92% /

This means your main 30GB disk is 92% full, with only 2.5GB of free space. Building a Docker image, especially one involving large models, requires significantly more space than that. The build fails because it has no room to write the necessary files.

The Solution
You have two options, but the second one is the permanent fix.

1. Immediate Cleanup (Short-term Fix)
You can try to free up space by removing old and unused Docker data. This command will delete all stopped containers, unused networks, and dangling images.

Run this on your server:

Bash

sudo docker system prune -af
After it finishes, run df -h again to see how much space was cleared. This might be enough to get one build to succeed, but the problem will likely return.

2. Increase Disk Size (Permanent Fix)
This is the correct long-term solution. You need to increase the storage capacity of your EC2 server.

Go to your AWS EC2 Console.

Find your instance and navigate to its Storage tab.

Select the Volume ID and choose to Modify it.

Increase the Size from 30GB to at least 50GB (or more, depending on your needs).

After you increase the volume size and restart the instance, your server will have enough space. Your docker-compose build command will finally have the room it needs to complete successfully.







updated to 70Gb



Show thinking
Excellent. That's the permanent fix. With 70GB of space, the "no space left on device" error will be resolved.

Your server now has the resources it needs to build the application.

## Final Step: Run the Build
Now you can run the build command on your server one last time to confirm that everything is working.

SSH into your server.

Run the build command:

Bash

# Navigate to your project folder
cd ~/miso-factory-repo

# Run the build
sudo /usr/local/bin/docker-compose up --build -d
The command should now complete without any space-related errors. Your application will be running successfully on your server. 🎉

Here's the SSH command to connect to your server.

PowerShell

ssh -i "C:\Users\kyle\miso-factory-repo\pem\MISO-Forge-Key.pem" ec2-user@44.197.204.43
Note: Remember, ec2-user is the default for Amazon Linux. If your server uses Ubuntu, the username will be ubuntu.

Show thinking
That error is happening because you're running the SSH command in the wrong place.

Your terminal prompt ([ec2-user@ip-172-31-78-151...]$) shows you are already logged into your server. You need to run the ssh command from your own local computer, not from the server itself.

The Permission denied error occurs because the server can't find the key file path C:\Users\kyle\..., as that path only exists on your Windows PC.

The Solution
Disconnect From the Server
In your current terminal, type exit and press Enter. This will log you out of the EC2 server.

Bash

exit
Run the Command From Your PC
Now, open a new terminal on your own computer (PowerShell or Command Prompt) and run the SSH command from there.

PowerShell

ssh -i "C:\Users\kyle\miso-factory-repo\pem\MISO-Forge-Key.pem" ec2-user@44.197.204.43
This will connect you from your computer 💻 ➡️ to the server.

[ec2-user@ip-172-31-78-151 miso-factory-repo]$




Show thinking
Excellent progress! The server space issue is solved, and this new error is a simple file path problem that is easy to fix.

This error means the Docker build process, which is started by docker-compose, cannot find your requirements.txt file.

The Root Cause
Your docker-compose.yml file is in the main project directory, but the requirements.txt file and its corresponding Dockerfile are inside the python_agent_runner subdirectory. The COPY requirements.txt . command in your Dockerfile is looking for the file in the wrong place because the "build context" (the set of files Docker can see) is not set correctly.

The Solution
We need to edit the main docker-compose.yml file to tell it exactly where to find the files for your Python application. This is a code change, so you will do this on your local computer and then push the fix.

On your local PC, open the docker-compose.yml file located in the root of your project.

Find the service for your python application (it might be called app, miso_app, python_agent, etc.).

Modify the build configuration for that service to look exactly like this:

YAML

# Inside your docker-compose.yml file...

services:
  miso_app: # Or whatever your python service is named
    build:
      context: ./python_agent_runner
      dockerfile: Dockerfile
    # ... keep the rest of your service configuration (ports, volumes, etc.)
Your Next Steps
After editing and saving the docker-compose.yml file on your local machine:

Commit and push the fix from your local PC:

PowerShell

git add docker-compose.yml
git commit -m "fix(build): Correct docker-compose build context"
git push
Deploy the fix on your server:

Bash

# SSH into your server first
ssh -i "path/to/your-key.pem" ec2-user@your-server-ip

# Once connected, run these commands
cd ~/miso-factory-repo
git reset --hard origin/main
sudo /usr/local/bin/docker-compose up --build -d
This will pull the corrected docker-compose.yml file to your server, and the build will now be able to find requirements.txt and succeed.







give me the entire docker-compose code



Show thinking
Of course. Based on your project structure and the problems we've solved, here is a complete and corrected docker-compose.yml file. This defines both your Python application and the Nginx proxy.

## Complete docker-compose.yml
Replace the entire content of the docker-compose.yml file in the root of your project with the code below.

YAML

version: '3.8'

services:
  # The Python/Flask application service
  miso_app:
    # THIS IS THE CORRECTED BUILD CONFIGURATION
    # It tells Docker to look inside the python_agent_runner folder for the files.
    build:
      context: ./python_agent_runner
      dockerfile: Dockerfile
    # This exposes the application's port for Nginx to connect to.
    # It does NOT make it accessible from the outside world.
    expose:
      - "5000"

  # The Nginx reverse proxy service
  nginx:
    build:
      context: ./nginx
      dockerfile: Dockerfile
    ports:
      # This maps port 80 from your server to port 80 in the Nginx container,
      # making your application accessible via the server's IP address.
      - "80:80"
    # This ensures that Nginx will only start after the miso_app is running.
    depends_on:
      - miso_app

## What This File Does
miso_app service: This section now correctly tells Docker to use the ./python_agent_runner folder as the build context. This is the key fix that solves the "requirements.txt": not found error.

nginx service: This builds your Nginx proxy and makes your application available to the internet on port 80. It is configured to wait for the miso_app service to be ready before it starts.

## Your Next Steps
Save this new content in the docker-compose.yml file on your local computer.

Commit and push the change.

PowerShell

git add docker-compose.yml
git commit -m "fix(build): Implement final docker-compose configuration"
git push
SSH into your server and run the deployment commands one last time.

Bash

cd ~/miso-factory-repo
git reset --hard origin/main
sudo /usr/local/bin/docker-compose up --build -d

[ec2-user@ip-172-31-78-151 miso-factory-repo]$




Show thinking
This is great news! The build was successful, which means the disk space and file path issues are completely solved. This new error is a simple cleanup issue and is the final step to getting your application running.

The error Conflict. The container name is already in use means an old, stopped container from a previous failed attempt is still on your system. You just need to remove it before starting the new one.

The Solution
You will run one command to clean up the old containers, and a second command to start the new ones fresh.

Stop and Remove Old Containers
Run the down command. This will read your docker-compose.yml file and cleanly remove the old containers.

Bash

sudo /usr/local/bin/docker-compose down
Start the Application Fresh
Now that the old containers are gone, run the up command again. It will build and start your application without any conflicts.

Bash

sudo /usr/local/bin/docker-compose up --build -d
After running these two commands, your containers will start, and your application will be running. You're at the finish line! 🎉
