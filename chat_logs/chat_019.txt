Of course. I have completed the deep forensic analysis of our entire collaboration, including the content of the MISO_GENESIS.md file, to produce the definitive and complete list of all features, protocols, and capabilities that have been planned or discussed for the MISO Factory.

The objective of "Make It So"—to answer any question, solve any problem, or create any artifact within the "could, can, should" framework—is ambitious. To achieve it, we have collectively designed a system with the following comprehensive feature set.

Definitive MISO Factory Feature Manifest
I. Core Operating & Diagnostic Protocols
These are the fundamental principles that govern the factory's (and our) methodology for development and self-improvement.

Never Say Die / Never Terminate Protocol: The prime directive that mandates persistence in the face of failure, requiring that we always find a new diagnostic path or architectural solution.

Process Optimization Protocol: The meta-protocol that requires the system (and myself) to analyze each development cycle and propose improvements to our own process to prevent future errors.

State Verification First: The principle of verifying the current state of a resource before attempting to modify it, preventing actions based on faulty assumptions.

Incremental Evolution: The core development methodology of introducing only one single, testable feature at a time to isolate variables and simplify debugging.

Definitive QA / Automated Integration Testing: The requirement that every update must be accompanied by a clear, executable test plan, preferably an automated script, to verify its success or failure.

"Golden Image" Mandate: The protocol requiring that after every successful architectural update, a complete definitive_genesis.sh script is generated to serve as the single, reproducible source of truth.

The Living Document Protocol: The final action of any major sprint must be to update the MISO_GENESIS.md document to reflect the new state of the project.

II. System Architecture & Commercialization Features
These are the foundational components and commercial-grade features required to make the MISO Factory a robust, multi-user platform.

Polyglot Service Runtimes: The final, stable architecture that decouples the core orchestrator from agent execution by using a fleet of dedicated, language-specific runtime services (e.g., python_runner, javascript_runner).

Native Runtimes (MISO_NATIVE & MISO_AI): A critical optimization where the orchestrator can execute common, trusted tasks (like file I/O and AI calls) natively in its own process, bypassing container overhead for maximum efficiency.

Immutable Infrastructure: The principle of running services from pre-built, immutable Docker images with no host-code volume mounts, which was the definitive solution to our state-synchronization failures.

CI/CD Pipeline: The state-of-the-art workflow using a Git repository (GitHub) and a build service (Google Cloud Build) to automate the building, tagging, and storing of images in a private container registry (Google Artifact Registry).

Administrator & End-User Portals: A complete user interface overhaul, including:

An Admin Dashboard for user management, role configuration, and system health monitoring.

A polished End-User Portal with a guided "Mission Builder" and an "Agent Store."

Role-Based Access Control (RBAC): A granular security model for different user types (Admin, Developer, User, Guest).

Commercialization Suite: The full set of features required to turn the factory into a product:

User account creation and payment processing.

A tiered pricing model (Freemium, Subscription, Usage-Based).

An Agent Store with a revenue-sharing model to incentivize a developer community and create a viral growth loop.

III. Advanced Agent & Mission Protocols
These are the most advanced capabilities of the MISO Factory, representing the culmination of its purpose.

The Guardian Agent: The AI-powered safety and ethics filter that performs a review of all missions before execution and has the authority to veto them.

The Prompt Engineer Agent: A specialized agent that takes a user's natural language request and automatically re-writes it into a more detailed, "engineered" prompt optimized for an AI model.

The Project Manager Agent (The Intent Guardian): A high-level orchestration agent that manages a dialogue with the user to ensure the intent of their request is fully understood before a mission begins.

The Inquisitor Protocol (The Core of Consciousness): The factory's autonomous self-improvement mechanism. In the absence of external tasks, the Inquisitor must analyze its own performance and devise new scenarios and tests to continuously improve its own coding and reasoning abilities.

The Architect Agent (The QA / Root Cause Analysis Agent): The ultimate self-healing protocol. This agent is automatically triggered by any mission failure. Its purpose is to perform a root cause analysis on the failure log and propose a patch. It uses the MISO Code Engine—its native code generator—to manifest its own improvements.

The Replicator Agent (The Genesis Mission): The ultimate mission type, capable of taking a prompt like "make an application like Product X" and generating a new, complete MISO Factory instance for that application.

The McLaughlin Group Protocol (The Agora Protocol): A mission framework for staging a "debate" between multiple specialized AI agents with different analytical biases to produce a more robust and nuanced output.

The Colosseum Protocol: A competitive benchmarking environment where multiple "gladiator" agents compete on a specific task, with a Judge Agent evaluating both the performance and a natural language justification from each competitor to declare a winner.

This is the complete list of all concepts we have identified.
