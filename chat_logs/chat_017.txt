Show thinking
Of course. After a deep forensic analysis of our entire chat history, including the content of the uploaded log files, I have identified and compiled a complete list of every feature enhancement and major capability discussed or planned for the "Make It So" (MISO) Autonomous Agent Factory.

Here is the comprehensive breakdown:

Core Architectural and Foundational Capabilities
These are the fundamental systems that form the MISO factory's core.

v3.0 'Cognition' Architecture: The master blueprint for the entire system. It's an intelligent, self-evolving automation platform designed to translate natural language intent into executable software agents.

Cognitive Engine: The central "brain" of the factory. It uses Large Language Models to understand a user's high-level goals and break them down into actionable agent configurations.

Objective Synthesis Engine: A proactive component that analyzes the entire agent ecosystem. Its purpose is to identify flaws, inefficiencies (like orphaned agents), and opportunities for improvement, and then propose new objectives back to the user.

Genesis Protocol: The official, step-by-step production deployment plan to instantiate the factory from its blueprint onto a live server. This includes infrastructure requirements, dependency installations, and validation checks.

Persistent Long-Term Memory (ChromaDB): A vector database that provides the factory and its agents with a searchable, long-term memory. This allows agents to share knowledge and learn from past operations without direct communication.

Event-Driven node-cron Scheduler: The internal clock and trigger system. It allows for the precise scheduling of autonomous tasks and enables complex, chained workflows where one agent's completion triggers another.

Specific Agent-Based Features and Systems
These are specific, advanced systems to be built by the MISO factory once it is operational.

Meta-Cognitive Coding Agent ("Agent Coder"): This is the most advanced feature planned. It's a self-improving system designed to learn how to code by:

Corpus Collection: Gathering code solutions from multiple LLMs for a single problem.

Static & Dynamic Analysis: Analyzing the code for quality, performance, and errors in a secure sandbox.

Pattern Synthesis: Identifying the most effective coding patterns and best practices from the analysis.

Heuristic Knowledge Base: Storing these learned best practices in its own long-term memory.

Self-Refinement: Using its own knowledge base to generate new, better code and creating a continuous learning loop.

Data Harvester Agent: A proposed agent that can fetch information from various sources.

Data Analyzer Agent: A proposed agent designed to be triggered by the Data Harvester to process the information it gathers, demonstrating a multi-agent workflow.

Operational Protocols and Self-Improvement Mechanisms
These are the guiding principles and built-in "philosophies" that govern the factory's operation.

Autonomous Objective Synthesis Loop: The active, running process where the factory continuously monitors itself and its agents to propose new, value-added objectives.

Event-Driven Multi-Agent Workflows: The capability to create complex chains of actions where agents work together without direct user intervention for each step.

High-Fidelity Genesis Protocol: The principle that all deployment and operational instructions must be precise, unambiguous, and verifiable.

"Never Say Die" Diagnostics: An operational protocol where the system, upon encountering an error, immediately enters a root-cause analysis mode to resolve the issue rather than giving up or proposing a new architecture.

Golden Image Optimization: A demonstrated capability where the factory analyzed its own deployment process and proposed building a custom, more efficient "golden image" for its agents to accelerate future deployments. This proves its ability to optimize its own systems.
