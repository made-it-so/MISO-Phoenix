## 1. High-Level Objective ##

To create a functional HTML/CSS mockup of a CEO dashboard providing comprehensive business situational awareness.

## 2. Key Architectural Decisions & Features Implemented ##

* **Structure:** HTML used for semantic layout of KPI cards and alert items within a flexible, card-based layout.
* **Styling:** CSS employed for visual presentation, including color scheme (RAG status indicators), typography, spacing, shadows, and borders, with CSS variables for easy theme management.
* **KPI Cards:** Implemented static KPI cards with placeholders for dynamic data (revenue, market share, project status) and visual elements (sparklines, mini bar charts, progress bars).
* **Alerts Panel:** Created a styled alerts panel with categorized alerts (critical, warning, informational) and icons.
* **File Type Association Fix:** Resolved an issue with the operating system associating .html files with a text editor instead of a web browser, ensuring proper rendering of the HTML file.

## 3. Final Code State ##

    <header class="dashboard-header">
        <h1>CEO Situational Awareness Dashboard</h1>
    </header>

    <div class="dashboard-row">
         <div class="kpi-cards-container">
             </div>
        </div>

        <div class="alerts-panel">
        </div>
    </div>

    </body>
</html>
```

## 4. Unresolved Issues & Next Steps ##

* The provided code is a static mockup.  Dynamic data fetching, charting, interactivity (drill-downs, etc.), and real-time updates are not implemented and would require JavaScript and backend development.
* Responsiveness for various screen sizes needs further development using media queries.
* Integration with data sources, business logic, and AI/ML components is required for a fully functional dashboard.
