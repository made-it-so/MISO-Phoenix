## 1. High-Level Objective ##

Debug and deploy the `discovery-interview-service` to AWS ECS Fargate.

## 2. Key Architectural Decisions & Features Implemented ##

* Refactored application to use Flask and provide a `/health` endpoint.
* Increased task memory to 4GB.
* Updated Dockerfile to expose port 8080, matching the ECS service and ALB listener configuration.
* Set `assignPublicIp=DISABLED` in the ECS service creation command.
* Defined a comprehensive project manifest (v34.0) incorporating features like the Colosseum Protocol, Agentic Self-Play, Hybrid Intelligence Strategy, and Dynamic Mission Planning Engine.

## 3. Final Code State ##

```dockerfile
FROM python:3.11-slim
WORKDIR /app
ENV PYTHONPATH=/app
COPY requirements.txt .
RUN pip install -r requirements.txt
COPY . .
EXPOSE 8080
CMD ["gunicorn", "--bind", "0.0.0.0:8080", "app:app"]
```

## 4. Unresolved Issues & Next Steps ##

* **AWS Deployment Failure:** Despite numerous fixes, the `discovery-interview-service` remains unhealthy. The next step is to analyze the latest traceback log from the failing task to determine the root cause.
* **Oracle Enhancement:** Upgrade the Oracle's reasoning prompt to leverage the Knowledge Graph as its primary reasoning framework, mirroring the MeshSplat principle.
* **MISO Application Forge UI Implementation.**
* **Full Colosseum Protocol Implementation.**
* **AI-Assisted Development Engine Implementation (Refactoring & Docstrings).**
* **Legacy Code Modernization Pipeline Implementation.**
* **Enterprise Hardening (Security, Resumability, Stateful Context).**
