## 1. High-Level Objective ##

To determine the best GUI framework and visualization techniques for displaying dynamic information for real-time situational awareness applications.

## 2. Key Architectural Decisions & Features Implemented ##

* **Web-based dashboards** identified as most common approach due to accessibility and platform independence.  Specific technologies mentioned included JavaScript frameworks (React, Vue.js, Angular) combined with visualization libraries (D3.js, ECharts, Plotly.js, Highcharts), or Python frameworks like Plotly Dash and Streamlit.  Also, dedicated dashboarding platforms like Grafana and Kibana were considered.
* **Desktop-based GUIs** acknowledged as viable for high-performance or hardware-specific needs, including Qt (C++/Python), WPF/UWP (C#), and JavaFX.
* **Bubble charts and proportional symbol maps** chosen as primary visualization methods for representing priority using varying circle sizes.  Emphasis placed on scaling by area, not radius, and including a clear legend.

## 3. Final Code State ##

No code was written or modified in this session.

## 4. Unresolved Issues & Next Steps ##

* No specific unresolved issues were identified.
* The next step would involve selecting a specific GUI framework and visualization library based on the project's specific requirements and constraints, and then implementing the chosen visualization techniques.  The discussion provides a solid foundation for making these decisions.
