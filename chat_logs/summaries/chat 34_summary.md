## 1. High-Level Objective ##

Deploy the MISO application, Colosseum Sandbox, and MISO_Orchestrator to AWS and activate the orchestrator for autonomous operation.

## 2. Key Architectural Decisions & Features Implemented ##

* Created `M365_Agent` (mocked implementation) for Microsoft 365 and Power Automate integration using the Microsoft Graph API.
* Defined the M365_Agent's ability to infer the appropriate tool (Power Automate) from user requests.
* Resolved the AWS cloud blocker (incorrect CloudFormation resource type and VPC limit).
* Deployed the Colosseum Sandbox to AWS.
* Deployed the main MISO application (v3.0.0) to the production ECS cluster.
* Created `Dockerfile` and built the image for the MISO_Orchestrator.
* Created a new ECR repository for the Orchestrator image.



## 3. Final Code State ##

**agents/m365_agent.py**

```python
import json

class M365_Agent:
    """
    An agent specializing in Microsoft 365 integrations,
    acting as an abstraction layer for services like Power Automate.
    """
    def __init__(self):
        print("M365_Agent initialized. (Currently in mocked mode).")

    def _infer_tool(self, user_request):
        """
        Analyzes a user request to determine the appropriate M365 tool.
        """
        print(f"\nAnalyzing request: '{user_request}'")
        if "every time" in user_request or "when" in user_request or "automatically" in user_request:
            tool = "Power Automate"
            print(f"Inferred tool: {tool}")
            return tool
        return "Unknown"

    def process_request(self, user_request):
        """
        The main entry point for the agent. It infers the tool and executes the task.
        """
        tool = self._infer_tool(user_request)

        if tool == "Power Automate":
            print("Translating request into a Power Automate flow definition...")
            flow_details = {
                "trigger": "On new email with attachment from 'boss@example.com'",
                "action": "Save attachment to SharePoint 'Reports' folder"
            }
            return self.create_flow(flow_details)
        else:
            return {"status": "FAILED", "message": "Could not determine the correct M365 tool for this request."}

    def create_flow(self, flow_details):
        """
        Simulates the creation of a Power Automate flow via the MS Graph API.
        """
        print("Simulating MS Graph API call to create Power Automate flow...")
        print(f"Flow Details: {json.dumps(flow_details, indent=2)}")
        return {"status": "SUCCESS", "flow_name": "Save Boss Attachments to SharePoint", "flow_id": "flow-123-abc"}

```

**orchestrator.Dockerfile**

```dockerfile
FROM python:3.11
WORKDIR /app
COPY . .
RUN pip install --no-cache-dir -r requirements.txt
CMD ["python", "miso_main.py"]
```



## 4. Unresolved Issues & Next Steps ##

* Activate the MISO_Orchestrator as a persistent service in the AWS cloud. This involves building the orchestrator image, deploying it to the main ECS cluster, and verifying its autonomous operation.  This was interrupted by a disk space error on the local machine.
* Backlog items from the project manifest:
    * UI Refinements & Project Proposal Interface
    * Microsoft 365 & Power Automate Integration (beyond the mocked implementation)
    * Internal Economic Model (Epic V2.0)
    * MISO Application Forge (4 phases)
    * MISO Agent Forge
    * Code Oracle (Enterprise Edition - 4 features)
