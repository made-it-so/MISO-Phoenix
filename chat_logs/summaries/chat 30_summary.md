## 1. High-Level Objective ##

To summarize the current state of the MISO project, define next steps, and prepare for cloud deployment pending resolution of an AWS account issue.

## 2. Key Architectural Decisions & Features Implemented ##

* **Completed local prototyping**: All planned features from the MISO manifest (v22.0) have been prototyped in Python.
* **"Parallel Path" Development Strategy**: Due to a blocking AWS issue, development shifted to local prototyping of all feasible features.
* **Finalized Project Manifest (v22.0)**: Consolidated all features and served as a blueprint for development.
* **Geopolitical Sovereignty Module**: Designed and tested locally, enabling MISO to analyze and respond to geopolitical events impacting system architecture.
* **Compliance Agent**: Designed and tested locally, allowing MISO to audit workflows against corporate policies.

## 3. Final Code State ##

```python
import os
import json
from miso_core import MISO # We use the MISO Core to access the reasoning engine

# --- The "World" (Mock Knowledge Core) ---
knowledge_core = {
    "New_Law": {
        "name": "The Canadian Digital Charter Act",
        "jurisdiction": "Canada",
        "key_requirement": "All personal data (PII) of Canadian citizens must be stored and processed on infrastructure located physically within Canada."
    },
    "Current_Architecture": {
        "global_instance": "us-east-1 (N. Virginia)",
        "canadian_customer_data_location": "us-east-1"
    }
}

def geopolitical_counsel_logic(event, current_state):
    """
    Core AI Logic for the Geopolitical Sovereignty Module.
    Analyzes an event and proposes a compliant architectural change.
    """
    print("ðŸ‡¨ðŸ‡¦ Geopolitical Counsel: Analyzing new regulatory event...")
    
    miso = MISO()

    prompt = f"""
    ... (rest of geopolitical_agent.py code as shown in the log) ...
    """

# compliance_agent.py also exists, but latest iteration not fully included in final log excerpt.

```

## 4. Unresolved Issues & Next Steps ##

* **AWS Account Issue**: ECS Fargate tasks cannot reliably run or connect to other AWS services, blocking cloud deployment. Awaiting resolution from AWS Support.
* **Next Step**: Prepare for deployment by consolidating the disparate Python scripts into a clean, final project structure with a logical directory layout (e.g., /agents, /core, /protocols) and a main application entry point.
* **Suggestions for Improvement**: Add an "Emotional Resonance" engine, a Causal Inference Engine, and an Ethical Deliberation Engine to improve human interaction and decision-making capabilities.
