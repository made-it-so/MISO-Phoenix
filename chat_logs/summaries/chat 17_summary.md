## 1. High-Level Objective ##

To document and analyze the planned features and architecture of the "Make It So" (MISO) Autonomous Agent Factory, particularly its v3.0 'Cognition' architecture.


## 2. Key Architectural Decisions & Features Implemented ##

* **v3.0 'Cognition' Architecture:**  A self-evolving automation platform translating natural language into software agents.
* **Cognitive Engine:** Uses LLMs to understand user goals and configure agents.
* **Objective Synthesis Engine:** Analyzes the agent ecosystem for flaws and improvement opportunities.
* **Genesis Protocol:**  Deployment plan for the factory.
* **Persistent Long-Term Memory (ChromaDB):**  Vector database for shared agent knowledge.
* **Event-Driven node-cron Scheduler:** Schedules autonomous tasks and workflows.
* **Meta-Cognitive Coding Agent ("Agent Coder"):**  A self-improving coding agent with corpus collection, static/dynamic analysis, pattern synthesis, and a heuristic knowledge base.
* **Data Harvester Agent & Data Analyzer Agent:** Proposed agents demonstrating multi-agent workflows.
* **Golden Image Optimization:** Demonstrated capability where the factory optimized its own agent deployment process.
