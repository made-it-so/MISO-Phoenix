## 1. High-Level Objective ##
To finalize the MISO Factory infrastructure code and validate its end-to-end functionality, particularly focusing on implementing infrastructure optimizations and addressing the broken web interface.

## 2. Key Architectural Decisions & Features Implemented ##

* **Consolidated CI/CD IAM Roles:** Merged separate IAM roles for backend and frontend pipelines into a single role within `main.tf` to reduce complexity.
* **Restored Frontend Infrastructure:** Reintroduced previously removed resources for the frontend, including S3 bucket, CloudFront distribution, and associated IAM policies and CI/CD pipelines to `main.tf`, correcting previous errors.

## 3. Final Code State ##

```terraform
#
# MISO FACTORY - FINAL, VALIDATED, AND COMPLETE INFRASTRUCTURE
#

# ... (Full code from the final main.tf provided in the chat log)
```

## 4. Unresolved Issues & Next Steps ##

* **Broken Web Interface:** The web interface remains broken, preventing full system testing.
* **Apply Terraform Configuration:** The immediate next step is to execute `terraform init -reconfigure` and `terraform apply` within the `C:\dev\miso\terraform\` directory to deploy the corrected infrastructure.
* **Implement New Manifest Features:** After infrastructure deployment, implement and test the remaining features outlined in the manifest (v9.0) that do not rely on the web interface. This includes agent logic implementation, dynamic pipeline generation, circuit breaker pattern, internal QA protocols, agent store development, operational hardening, and recursive self-improvement.
* **Start a New Chat Session:** A new chat session should be initiated using the provided engineered prompt to guide the next phase of development with a fresh AI instance focused on applying the validated infrastructure and completing agent logic.
