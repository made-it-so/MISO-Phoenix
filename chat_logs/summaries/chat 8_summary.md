## 1. High-Level Objective ##
Troubleshoot and resolve a persistent 503 Service Unavailable error when accessing a web application fronted by API Gateway and backed by an ECS service running on Fargate.

## 2. Key Architectural Decisions & Features Implemented ##
* **Simplified API Gateway Integration:** Removed the complex VPC Link configuration from the API Gateway and switched to a direct, public integration with the Application Load Balancer (ALB) to bypass potential VPC Link issues.
* **Switched from FIFO to Standard SQS Queues:** Changed the SQS queues from FIFO to Standard to resolve a MessageGroupId requirement issue in the application code causing 500 Internal Server Errors.
* **Corrected CORS Configuration:** Updated the API Gateway's CORS configuration to explicitly allow requests from the frontend application (running on localhost) including Authorization headers.
* **Removed Cognito Authorizer:**  Temporarily disabled the Cognito JWT Authorizer to isolate authentication-related issues as the root cause of 500 errors.
* **Modified Dockerfile to Include Dependencies:** Added `requirements.txt` and updated the Dockerfile to install the missing `boto3` dependency required by the application.
* **Fixed entryPoint in Task Definition:** Overridden the default entrypoint in the `aws_ecs_task_definition` to include an `echo` and `sleep` command to aid in debugging.
* **Switched to a known-good container (Nginx):** Deployed an Nginx test container to isolate application vs infrastructure issues.

## 4. Unresolved Issues & Next Steps ##
* **Debug application's Dockerfile and main application code:** The root cause was ultimately identified as a missing dependency (`boto3`) in the application's Dockerfile causing container startup failure. Though a workaround using a known good Nginx container was implemented, the Dockerfile needs to be corrected to include the missing dependency.  The application itself should also handle cases where critical environment variables are not set.
