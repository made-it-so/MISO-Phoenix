## 1. High-Level Objective ##

To enhance the "Make It So" (MISO) and "MISO Factory" projects with advanced features like strategic planning, multi-agent collaboration, expanded tooling, and broader system integrations, ultimately culminating in a production-grade system.

## 2. Key Architectural Decisions & Features Implemented ##

* **Strategic Thinking Module:** Agents will decompose complex tasks into sub-tasks.
* **Modular LLM Integration:** Support for multiple LLM providers (Google, OpenAI, Anthropic).
* **Persistent Memory and Learning (Phase 7):** Integration of ChromaDB for long-term memory.
* **Self-Correction and Healing (Phase 9):** Agents analyze and correct code errors.
* **Meta-Awareness Agent System ("Observer"):** A meta-agent monitors the primary agent's performance.
* **Multi-Agent Collaboration (Phase 8):** Specialized agent roles (Code Reviewer, Project Manager, Auditor/QA/Debugger).
* **Expanded Toolset (Phase 6):** Web Search, API Interaction, Code Linter, Database Interaction.
* **3D Printing and On-Demand Manufacturing:** Agents generate CAD models and G-code.
* **VR/AR Integration:** Immersive interfaces for digital twins and data visualization.
* **"Pull" Architecture:** Agents pull data via API instead of the factory pushing data.
* **Human-Computer Interface (Phase 10):** Web interface with task input, logs, and agent responses.
* **"Project Phoenix" Sprints:** Plan for a production-ready, containerized factory using Node.js, React, and Docker.

## 3. Final Code State ##

No code was included in the provided chat log.

## 4. Unresolved Issues & Next Steps ##

* Implement the features outlined in the "Project Phoenix" sprints, including the persistent SQLite database, static UI, Docker Compose orchestration, agent task execution, and real-time log streaming.
* Continue development on the core enhancements (strategic thinking, multi-agent collaboration, expanded tooling, integrations).
* Build the planned Human-Computer Interface.
* Implement the "Make It So" framework principles (Awareness, Resiliency, Adaptability, and Fidelity).
