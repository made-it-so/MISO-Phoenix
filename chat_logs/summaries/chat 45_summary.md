## 1. High-Level Objective ##

To resolve a persistent login issue blocking access to the MISO Mission Control web application and then proceed with implementing the next stage of the MISO Manifest v51.0, specifically the SimulationAgent.

## 2. Key Architectural Decisions & Features Implemented ##

* **Co-located Deployment:** Moved the entire MISO Docker application (FastAPI API, React UI) onto the same AWS server as the Ollama LLM to bypass network blocks.
* **Corrected Configuration:** Fixed the `apiClient.js`, `api_main.py`, and `genesis_router.py` files to address CORS issues, incorrect network pointers, and Python import errors that prevented the API server from starting.
* **SimulationAgent Design:** Defined the `SimulationAgent` class and its `simulate` method to perform basic validation of the project plan.
* **SimulationAgent Integration:** Modified the `orchestrator.py` to include the `SimulationAgent` as the fourth step in the Genesis Pipeline.

## 3. Final Code State ##

```python
# miso_api/agents.py
class SimulationAgent:
    """
    Simulates the execution of the project plan to identify potential flaws.
    """
    def simulate(self, project_plan_json: str) -> (bool, str):
        print("SIMULATION_AGENT: Running simulation on project plan...")
        project_plan = json.loads(project_plan_json)

        if "files" not in project_plan or not project_plan["files"]:
            rationale = "Simulation failed: Project plan contains no files to generate."
            print(f"SIMULATION_AGENT: {rationale}")
            return False, rationale
        
        rationale = "Simulation successful: Project plan is coherent and actionable."
        print(f"SIMULATION_AGENT: {rationale}")
        return True, rationale


# miso_api/orchestrator.py
import os
import json
from . import agents

def run_pipeline(job_id: str, prompt: str):
    """
    Orchestrates the full Genesis Pipeline, now including the SimulationAgent.
    """
    print(f"ORCHESTRATOR: Starting full pipeline for job {job_id}.")
    
    # ... (Existing code for EthicsAgent, PromptEnhancerAgent, PlanningAgent)

    # 4. SimulationAgent
    simulation_agent = agents.SimulationAgent()
    simulation_ok, sim_rationale = simulation_agent.simulate(project_plan_json)
    if not simulation_ok:
        return json.dumps({"message": f"Job failed: {sim_rationale}", "artifacts": [plan_path]})

    # 5. CodeGenerationAgent
    # ... (Existing code for CodeGenerationAgent)
```

## 4. Unresolved Issues & Next Steps ##

* **Test and Validate SimulationAgent:**  Submit a new prompt via the Mission Control UI and check the API container logs to verify that the SimulationAgent is running and its messages are appearing as expected.
* **Implement Remaining Agents:** Continue implementation of the DebuggingAgent and SecurityAgent according to the MISO Manifest v51.0.
* **Implement Advanced Reasoning:**  Begin work on integrating Parallel Thinking and Codex Memory functionality into the PlanningAgent as outlined in MIP-001.
