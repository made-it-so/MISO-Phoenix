## 1. High-Level Objective ##

To define and refine the architecture and functionality of the MISO Fusion platform, specifically focusing on knowledge representation, creative problem-solving, and self-improvement capabilities.

## 2. Key Architectural Decisions & Features Implemented ##

* **Knowledge Fabric (formerly Oracle Agent/OntologyAgent):**  Established as the central knowledge graph, incorporating top-down strategic context and bottom-up technical grounding derived from static and dynamic code analysis.  Initial implementation of the OntologyAgent for parsing Python code.
* **Cartographer Agent:** Defined as a capability of the DiscoveryAgent to visually map complex relationships within the Knowledge Fabric using Mermaid.js, enabling visual exploration of technical and business processes.
* **Creative Suite & Conceptual Leap Protocol:**  Formalized the process of generating and evaluating novel solutions using the AnalogyAgent, ImprovAgent, RedTeamAgent, and the Cartographer Agent for visualization.
* **MISO Strategic Advisory (MSA) Protocol:** Designed a protocol for MISO to analyze its own state and suggest improvements, including recursive self-improvement and automatic execution of approved plans.
* **Simulated General Intelligence (SGI) Protocol:**  Established a framework for controlled experimentation and innovation within MISO, comprising the Crucible (for generating and testing ideas), Codex (for storing past experiences), and Compass (for governance and alignment with goals).
* **Hybrid Post-Training (HPT) Algorithm:** Selected as the learning algorithm for the MISO LLM, dynamically switching between Supervised Fine-Tuning and Reinforcement Learning.
* **Memento Case Bank:** Integrated as MISO's long-term memory, storing the results of experiments and tasks for future reference and learning.

## 3. Final Code State ##

No final, complete code blocks were provided in the chat log. The initial implementation of the OntologyAgent was mentioned but no code was shared.

## 4. Unresolved Issues & Next Steps ##

* Implement the Knowledge Fabric by integrating and expanding the existing OntologyAgent.
* Implement the Cartographer Agent within the DiscoveryAgent.
* Implement the MSA and SGI protocols, including the Crucible, Codex, and Compass components.
* Integrate the HPT algorithm for training the MISO LLM.
* Build out the Memento Case Bank.
* Implement the Conceptual Leap Protocol within the Creative Suite.
* Continue implementing the MISO Fusion manifest, prioritizing "Need to Have" items.
