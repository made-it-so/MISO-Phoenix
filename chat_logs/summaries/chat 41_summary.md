## 1. High-Level Objective ##

Debug a project directory conflict in the MISO code generation pipeline and define the next steps for the project.

## 2. Key Architectural Decisions & Features Implemented ##

* **Unique Project Directories:** Implemented timestamped project directories in the `GenesisAgent` to prevent file conflicts during project creation.  This involved modifying the `create_codebase` method to append a timestamp to the project name.
* **Corrected Startup Prompt:**  Engineered a comprehensive startup prompt to enable a new MISO instance to quickly get up to speed on the project's history, current status, and next steps.  This prompt incorporates key learnings like the "Snapshot Imperative" and "Ghost in the Machine."  It also accurately reflects the resolved SQS issue and the system's readiness for Phase 2: Production Readiness.


## 3. Final Code State ##

```python
import logging
import os
import json
from datetime import datetime
# ... other imports

class GenesisAgent:
    # ... (other methods)

    def create_codebase(self, proposal: dict):
        base_project_name = proposal.get('project_name', 'untitled_project').replace(' ', '_').lower()
        timestamp = datetime.now().strftime("%Y%m%d_%H%M%S")
        project_name_unique = f"{base_project_name}_{timestamp}"
        
        objective = proposal.get("objective", "No objective provided.")
        project_path = os.path.join(self.output_dir, project_name_unique)

        self.logger.info(f"--- Starting New Project: {project_name_unique} ---")
        
        # ... (rest of the method - planning, simulation, generation, debugging, security)
```

## 4. Unresolved Issues & Next Steps ##

* **Next Mission:** Architect and implement the MISO Core API and the "Mission Control" Web Dashboard, evolving the Alpha Portal into a robust, secure, and scalable platform based on the "Hub and Spoke" model (Phase 2: Production Readiness).
* **No unresolved bugs** as the SQS issue was identified as an operational oversight (the deployed EC2 instance acting as an unintended consumer), not a bug in the system itself.  The issue was resolved by stopping the service on the EC2 instance.
