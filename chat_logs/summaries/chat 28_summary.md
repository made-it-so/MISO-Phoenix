## 1. High-Level Objective ##

To define the next phase of the MISO Factory (Alpha Platform) project, focusing on automating the CI/CD pipeline and planning the implementation of advanced architectural features like a fractal agent hierarchy and gRPC communication.

## 2. Key Architectural Decisions & Features Implemented ##

* Defined a comprehensive Project Manifest (v3.0) outlining current and future architectural goals, operating protocols, and the evolutionary roadmap.
* Created an engineered prompt for the next development chat session, focused on implementing Epoch III of the project roadmap.
* Designed a detailed project plan for implementing the fractal agent hierarchy, including the migration to gRPC/Protobuf for inter-service communication.

## 3. Final Code State ##

No code was implemented during this planning session.  Code changes were discussed but not executed.

## 4. Unresolved Issues & Next Steps ##

* Implement the CI/CD pipeline using GitHub Actions (carried over from a previous task).
* Begin Epoch III: Architectural Evolution, starting with the migration to gRPC/Protobuf as detailed in the project plan.
* Implement the remaining features outlined in the v3.0 Manifest, including the asynchronous message bus, circuit breaker pattern, production authentication, and advanced autonomous capabilities.
