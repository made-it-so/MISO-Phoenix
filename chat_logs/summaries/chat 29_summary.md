## 1. High-Level Objective ##

To conduct a forensic analysis of the chat logs and identify all planned or discussed feature enhancements for the "MISO" (Make it So) project.

## 2. Key Architectural Decisions & Features Implemented ##

* **Integrated "Librarian" Agent Functionality:** The proposed "Librarian" agent for memory management was deemed redundant and its functionality was integrated directly into the core `memory.js` service.

## 3. Final Code State ##

No code was provided in the given chat log.

## 4. Unresolved Issues & Next Steps ##

* **"Colosseum" Protocol Evolved:** The "Colosseum" protocol for competitive model selection was superseded by the more sophisticated "Agora Protocol" planned for a future sprint.
* **"Learning Router" Deferred:** The implementation of the "Learning Router" using reinforcement learning for intelligent agent selection was deferred to a future sprint.
* **Integration with External Engines:** The need to integrate with advanced external engines (simulation, AI, data management, HCI) for high-value use cases was identified as a future requirement.
