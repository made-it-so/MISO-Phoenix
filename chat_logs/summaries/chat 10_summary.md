## 1. High-Level Objective ##

To enhance the "Make It So" application by integrating a planning module, connecting to a live Large Language Model (LLM - Google Gemini), and enabling the agent to execute multi-step plans.

## 2. Key Architectural Decisions & Features Implemented ##

* **Planner Module Integration:**  The agent now uses a planning module to generate a multi-step plan before executing any actions.
* **Live LLM Connection:** The application was updated to connect to Google's Gemini LLM for real-time AI processing, replacing the previous simulation.
* **ReAct Loop Integration:** The agent utilizes a ReAct loop ("Thought -> Action -> Observation") to execute plan steps.
* **API Key Management:** The application now uses a .env file to securely store and access the Google API key.
* **Stricter Prompting:** The prompt structure sent to the LLM was revised to enforce a specific response format and minimize unexpected outputs.
* **Multi-Step Plan Execution:** The agent was upgraded to execute the entire generated plan sequentially.

## 3. Final Code State ##

```python
# app.py (with .env loader)
import streamlit as st
from dotenv import load_dotenv
import os

load_dotenv()

```


## 4. Unresolved Issues & Next Steps ##

* **LLM Hallucinations:** The LLM occasionally generates inaccurate summaries of its actions, requiring further investigation and potential improvements in prompt engineering or result verification.
* **Summary Reliability:**  Improve the reliability of the agent's final summaries to accurately reflect its completed actions.
