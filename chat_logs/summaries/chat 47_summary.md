## 1. High-Level Objective ##

To successfully deploy a full-stack application named "MISO Genesis Project" using Docker on a remote server.

## 2. Key Architectural Decisions & Features Implemented ##

* **Interactive Deployment Protocol:** Shifted from monolithic deployment scripts to a step-by-step, interactive approach for increased robustness and easier debugging.
* **Location-Independent Scripting:**  Modified the initial file generation script to ensure it always executes from the user's home directory (`~`) regardless of the initial execution location.
* **Automated Frontend Dockerfile Creation:** Included the frontend Dockerfile generation within the initial file creation script, eliminating a manual step and a source of errors.
* **Step-wise Dependency Installation:** Provided separate scripts for source code generation and host system provisioning (NVIDIA drivers, Docker, Node.js), allowing for focused execution and troubleshooting.


## 3. Final Code State ##

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# MISO Interactive Deployment - Step 1: Create All Project Files (Location Independent)

echo "--- MISO: Step 1 of 4 - Creating all project source files... ---"

# --- CRITICAL FIX: Establish a known-good execution context ---
cd ~

# --- Create Project Structure ---
rm -rf genesis_project
mkdir -p genesis_project/backend/agents
mkdir -p genesis_project/frontend-ui
cd genesis_project

# --- Generate All Correctly Formatted Project Files ---
# ... (All file content from final Step 1 script, condensed for brevity.  See original chat log for full code) ...

echo "--- ✅ Step 1 Complete. All project source files have been created. ---"
echo "--- You may now proceed with Step 2: Host System Provisioning. ---"

```

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# MISO Interactive Deployment - Step 2: Provision Host Dependencies

echo "--- MISO: Step 2 of 4 - Provisioning all host system dependencies... ---"
echo "--- This will take a considerable amount of time. Please be patient. ---"

# --- 2a. Install NVIDIA Drivers ---
# ... (NVIDIA driver installation commands)

# --- 2b. Install Modern Docker Engine ---
# ... (Docker installation commands)

# --- 2c. Install Modern Node.js ---
# ... (Node.js installation commands)


echo "--- ✅ Step 2 Complete. Host system provisioning is done. A reboot is required. ---"
echo "--- Please run 'sudo reboot' to proceed to Step 3. ---"
```

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# MISO Final Step: Correct and Execute Deployment

echo "--- MISO: Correcting the final deployment script with sudo... ---"

cat <<'EOF_DEPLOY' > /home/ubuntu/deploy_miso.sh
#!/bin/bash
echo "--- MISO: Executing final application deployment on prepared server. ---"
cd ~
#... (Rest of deploy_miso.sh content - see original chat log)
sudo docker compose up -d --build
#... (Rest of deploy_miso.sh content - see original chat log)
EOF_DEPLOY

echo "--- Script updated. Now executing... ---"
bash /home/ubuntu/deploy_miso.sh

```



## 4. Unresolved Issues & Next Steps ##

* **Next Step:** After rebooting the server, the user needs to reconnect via SSH and execute the `deploy_miso.sh` script from their home directory to build and launch the application.  The IP address for this connection was corrected to `13.221.193.130`.
*  No unresolved bugs are explicitly mentioned at the end of the log. The final step is pending user action (reconnecting and running final deployment).
