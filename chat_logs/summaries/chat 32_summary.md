## 1. High-Level Objective ##

To resolve a persistent cloud deployment issue blocking AWS deployment and to implement the "Live Upgrade Workflow" for the Code Oracle locally.

## 2. Key Architectural Decisions & Features Implemented ##

* Implemented the Live Upgrade Workflow for the Code Oracle, including code generation, unit test generation, and simulated pull request creation.
* Created a master project manifest file (MISO_PROJECT_STATUS.md) to track project status and facilitate future chat sessions.
* Upgraded the indexing script to use an LLM for structured code analysis and created a JSON Lines index file.
* Updated the query oracle to utilize the new intelligent JSON Lines index.

## 3. Final Code State ##

```python
# live_upgrade_workflow.py
import ollama
import logging
import os

# ... (rest of the code as shown in the chat log)
```

```python
# indexing_script.py
import os
import logging
import ollama
import json

# ... (rest of the code as shown in the chat log)
```

```python
# enterprise_query_oracle.py
import ollama
import logging
import json

# ... (rest of the code as shown in the chat log)
```



## 4. Unresolved Issues & Next Steps ##

* **Cloud Deployment Blocked:** The AWS deployment issue remains unresolved and is pending support from AWS.  All cloud-related work is on hold.
* **Next Step:**  Run the updated indexing script (`python indexing_script.py`) and then the query oracle (`python enterprise_query_oracle.py`) to test the enhanced Code Oracle functionality.  Continue building out the advanced business logic for the implemented agents, such as the full logic for the MISO Application Forge phases or the Code Oracle's automated RFP response workflow.
