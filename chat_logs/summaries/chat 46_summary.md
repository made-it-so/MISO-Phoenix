## 1. High-Level Objective ##

To debug and fix a Docker volume mounting issue preventing the File System Agent (FSAgent) from writing generated code files to the host machine in the MISO project, and to clarify the project roadmap and workflow.

## 2. Key Architectural Decisions & Features Implemented ##

* Corrected the Docker volume mapping in `docker-compose.yml` to encompass the entire project directory (`./:/app`) instead of just the backend directory.  This allows the FSAgent, running within the Docker container, to write to the correct location on the host machine.
* Modified the `backend/Dockerfile` to reflect the updated volume mapping.

## 3. Final Code State ##

```yaml
version: "3.8"
services:
  backend:
    build:
      context: .
      dockerfile: backend/Dockerfile
    ports: ["8000:8000"]
    volumes: ["./:/app"] # Corrected volume mapping
    environment:
      - OLLAMA_HOST=ollama
    networks: ["miso-net"]
  # ... other services
```

```dockerfile
FROM python:3.9-slim
WORKDIR /app/backend # Updated WORKDIR
# ... rest of Dockerfile
```

## 4. Unresolved Issues & Next Steps ##

* **Post-Bugfix Implementations:**
    * Implement the TestingAgent and the generate-test-debug loop.
    * Re-integrate Codex Memory and Parallel Thinking.
    * Implement the SchedulerAgent, ExecutiveAgent, and GitAgent.
* **Workflow Improvements (for future sessions):**
    * Start with a stable, pre-configured server environment.
    * Adopt an incremental workflow with single, complete command blocks for each feature addition.
    * Clarify simulation boundaries for external resources.
    * Use specific directives for focused AI actions.
