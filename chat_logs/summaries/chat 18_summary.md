## 1. High-Level Objective ##

To conduct a forensic analysis of the chat log and identify all planned or discussed feature enhancements for the "Make It So" Autonomous Agent Factory.

## 2. Key Architectural Decisions & Features Implemented ##

* **Core Architectural Sprints Defined:** A 10-sprint plan was outlined, covering core logic, knowledge base, tool integration, output generation, ethics, metacognition, multi-agent orchestration, interactive dialogue, deployment, and final system integration.  Sprint 9 (Deployment & Provisioning Agent) was actively implemented during the session.
* **High-Level Agent Protocols Designed:** "Prometheus" (self-improving coding agent) and "Athena" (self-improving reasoning agent) protocols were conceived.
* **Technology Stack Identified:** Node.js/Express.js (backend), React/Vite (frontend), SQLite (database), Docker/Docker Compose (orchestration), and Google Gemini Pro (cognitive engine).  Future integration of other LLMs like Anthropic Claude and OpenAI GPT is planned.
* **Operator-Mandated Protocols Established:**  Key principles include persistence, optimal pathfinding, high-fidelity/methodical approach, definitive QA, complete code context, forward-only diagnostics, and verifying assumptions.

## 3. Final Code State ##

No code was included in the provided chat log.

## 4. Unresolved Issues & Next Steps ##

The chat log primarily focuses on summarizing previous discussions and planning future work. No specific bugs or unresolved issues were mentioned. The next steps involve continuing the implementation of the 10-sprint plan, focusing on the remaining sprints after the current focus on Sprint 9.
