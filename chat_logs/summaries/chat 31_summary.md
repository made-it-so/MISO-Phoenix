## 1. High-Level Objective ##

To refine the architecture and resume the AWS deployment of the "Make It So" (MISO) AI ecosystem, focusing on the inquisitor-refiner service after resolving a prior AWS networking issue.

## 2. Key Architectural Decisions & Features Implemented ##

* **Refactored the inquisitor-refiner agent:** Moved core logic to `agent_core.py` with an `InquisitorAgent` class and updated `agent.py` to be a thin web server wrapper, improving modularity and testability.
* **Replaced keyword-based ambiguity analysis with LLM integration:**  The `InquisitorAgent` now uses the Ollama library and a local LLM (phi3) for more nuanced ambiguity detection.
* **Added Ollama to requirements:** Included the `ollama` library in `requirements.txt`.
* **Created Dockerfile for inquisitor-refiner:** Defined the containerization process for the service, including dependencies and runtime commands.
* **Created ECR repository:** Created a repository named `miso-inquisitor-refiner` in AWS ECR for storing the Docker image.

## 3. Final Code State ##

**agent_core.py:**

```python
import ollama
import logging

class InquisitorAgent:
    # ... (Content from the chat log)
```

**agent.py:**

```python
from flask import Flask, request, jsonify
from agent_core import InquisitorAgent
# ... (Content from the chat log)
```

**Dockerfile:**

```dockerfile
FROM python:3.11-slim
# ... (Content from the chat log)
```

**requirements.txt:**

```
Flask
boto3
ollama
```

## 4. Unresolved Issues & Next Steps ##

* **Deploy inquisitor-refiner to AWS ECS:** The next step is to deploy the newly built Docker image to the existing AWS ECS Fargate cluster, mirroring the deployment process of the `embedding-service`.  The specific Terraform code for this deployment still needs to be generated.
* **Local Code Indexing:** A local process is indexing the codebase using llama3, but this is not blocking the AWS deployment.  The status of this process and its eventual integration with the cloud deployment remains to be addressed.
* **Azure and local development workstreams:** These are currently on standby, with the main focus on resuming the AWS deployment.
