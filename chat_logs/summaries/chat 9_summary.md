## 1. High-Level Objective ##

To implement a self-healing capability for the "Make It So" autonomous agent factory, allowing the agent to debug and correct errors in its own generated code.

## 2. Key Architectural Decisions & Features Implemented ##

* **Self-Healing Logic in AgentManager:** Implemented logic within `src/factory/agent_manager.py` to detect execution errors (specifically `STDERR`) in the `execute_python_file` tool's output.  Upon error detection, the AgentManager initiates a debugging loop, prompting the agent to analyze the error, reread the file using `read_file`, and rewrite a corrected version using `write_to_file`.
* **New Test Script (`_test_self_healing_v2.py`):** Created a new test designed to induce a `NameError` in the agent's generated code to specifically trigger and validate the self-healing loop.  This involved the agent writing a script with an undefined variable, executing it, encountering the error, and then successfully correcting the script through the debugging loop.
* **Streamlit GUI (app.py):** Created a user-friendly web interface using Streamlit to interact with the agent.  The interface includes a task input area, a "Run" button, a final response display area, and a real-time log viewer.

## 3. Final Code State ##

```python
# src/factory/agent_manager.py (Self-Healing Version)
import json
import logging
# ... (rest of the code is quite long and identical to what was provided in the log.  Including it would make this summary less concise)
```

```python
# app.py
import streamlit as st
import logging
from src.factory.agent_manager import AgentManager

# --- Page Configuration ---
st.set_page_config(
# ... (rest of the code is quite long and identical to what was provided in the log.  Including it would make this summary less concise)
```

## 4. Unresolved Issues & Next Steps ##

* No unresolved bugs.
* Next steps are to begin Phase 10: Human-Computer Interface (GUI), focusing on building a simple web interface using Streamlit for interacting with the agent, replacing the command-line interface. This involves adding Streamlit to the project dependencies, creating the UI application script (app.py), and running the web application.  Further enhancements to the GUI, such as a more sophisticated real-time log viewer and an integrated file explorer, were also discussed for future development.
