## 1. High-Level Objective ##

To debug the deployment of a frontend application to a server and transition to developing the backend orchestrator for the "Make It So" AI agent factory (v2.0 architecture).

## 2. Key Architectural Decisions & Features Implemented ##

* **Local Build, Static Deploy:** Adopted a "build locally, deploy statically" approach for the frontend to address persistent deployment issues.
* **Dockerfile Simplification:**  The frontend Dockerfile was simplified to only serve pre-built static files using Nginx, removing the `npm install` and `npm run build` steps.
* **File Permission Fix:** Implemented a `chmod -R 755` command to correct file permissions on the server's `frontend/build` directory, allowing the Nginx user to access the static files.
* **Backend Orchestrator (Planned):** Initiated planning for Sprint 11, focusing on a dedicated backend orchestrator service (v1.6) using Express.js and CORS middleware within a Docker container.
* **Multi-Agent System (Planned):** Discussed the planned implementation of a multi-agent system using the DARPA Protocol and a metacognitive loop for task decomposition, parallel processing, and result integration.

## 3. Final Code State ##

```dockerfile
### Serve the production application with Nginx ###
FROM nginx:1.23-alpine

# Copy the pre-built application files from the 'build' directory
# into the Nginx web server's public directory.
COPY ./build /usr/share/nginx/html

# This is the new, critical command.
# It recursively sets read and execute permissions for all users
# on all files and directories inside the web root.
RUN chmod -R o+r /usr/share/nginx/html

# Copy the custom Nginx configuration file.
COPY nginx.conf /etc/nginx/conf.d/default.conf

# Expose port 80 for web traffic.
EXPOSE 80

# The default command to start the Nginx server.
CMD ["nginx", "-g", "daemon off;"]
```

## 4. Unresolved Issues & Next Steps ##

* **Frontend 404 Error:** Despite correcting file permissions, the frontend still returned a 404 error, suggesting a subtle issue with permissions within the Docker container itself (investigation postponed).
* **GUI Deployment Postponed:**  Frontend deployment was put on hold to focus on the backend orchestrator development.
* **Sprint 11: Backend Orchestrator:** The next step is to begin Sprint 11, creating the file structure, dependencies (`express`, `cors`), `server.js` file, and Dockerfile for the backend orchestrator service.
* **Long-Term Roadmap:** Continue development according to the "Make It So - Genesis, Evolution & Mission Sprints Overview" document (artifact `sprint_summary`).
