## 1. High-Level Objective ##

To deploy the MISO Factory application on AWS, focusing on resolving blocking issues and obtaining a stable, functioning deployment.

## 2. Key Architectural Decisions & Features Implemented ##

* **Network Configuration Fix:** Added a self-referential ingress rule to the security group for port 443 to allow ECS tasks to communicate with ECR VPC endpoints.
* **Application Code Fix:** Provided a compliant Flask application with a working `/health` endpoint to satisfy ALB health checks.
* **Dockerfile Hardening:** Modified the Dockerfile to copy only necessary files, removing conflicting older files.
* **External Dependency Resolution:** Manually verified the Amazon SES domain identity to unblock the creation of the Cognito User Pool.
* **ECR Cleanup:** Manually cleaned up the ECR repository through the AWS Management Console due to local AWS CLI issues.
* **Deployment Scripts:** Created scripts for pushing the Docker image and performing end-to-end validation of the application.

## 3. Final Code State ##

```terraform
#
# MISO FACTORY - FINAL, PRODUCTION-READY INFRASTRUCTURE
#
# ... (full content of main.tf as shown in the log) ...

```

## 4. Unresolved Issues & Next Steps ##

* **Persistent Service Unavailable Error:**  Despite all fixes and a full infrastructure rebuild, the application remained inaccessible with a "Service Unavailable" error and an empty ALB target group. The root cause remained undiagnosed and led to project termination.
* **Next Steps (Abandoned due to failure):** The proposed next step was to initiate a new chat session with a refined prompt, focusing on a phased, verifiable "steel thread" approach to rebuild the MISO Factory from scratch (v2.0), starting with a simple Nginx container deployment to validate core infrastructure. This was abandoned due to the unrecoverable nature of the primary failure.
* **Unimplemented Features:** All advanced agent features (Architect Agent, Engineer-Troubleshooter, Analyst-Disparity, Goal-Kernel, Resource-Broker) remained unimplemented.
