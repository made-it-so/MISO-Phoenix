## 1. High-Level Objective ##

To conduct a comprehensive analysis of the MISO Factory project's planned and implemented feature enhancements, including architectural decisions, protocols, and agent capabilities.

## 2. Key Architectural Decisions & Features Implemented ##

* **Core Protocols:** Implemented "Never Say Die", "Process Optimization", "State Verification First", "Phased/Incremental Evolution", "Living Document", "Golden Image Mandate", and "Definitive QA" protocols.
* **Microservice Architecture:** Implemented a polyglot microservice architecture using Docker containers and enforced a strict API contract with gRPC/Protobuf.
* **Asynchronous Communication:** Implemented an asynchronous message bus using Amazon SQS for decoupling services and scalability.
* **Resilience:** Implemented the Circuit Breaker pattern for backend robustness.
* **Agent Hierarchy:** Implemented a proof-of-concept for a fractal agent hierarchy with Genus (conductor) and Species (specialized) agents.
* **Goal Kernel & Resource Broker:** Implemented a "Goal Kernel" microservice for immutable agent directives and a "Resource Broker" using Redis for resource management.
* **Telemetry & Failure Feedback:** Implemented centralized logging with Amazon CloudWatch and a failure feedback loop with a Dead-Letter Queue (DLQ).
* **Inquisitor Protocol & Council of Elders:** Implemented the "Inquisitor Protocol" for agent self-improvement and the "Council of Elders" for human-in-the-loop approval of agent proposals.

## 3. Final Code State ##

No code was included in the provided chat log.

## 4. Unresolved Issues & Next Steps ##

* **Scalability & Orchestration:** Migration to Amazon ECS with Fargate is in progress but blocked.
* **Infrastructure as Code:** Adoption of Terraform is in progress but blocked.
* **New Agent Species:** Design phase complete for "Refiner" (Prompt Engineer), "Troubleshooter" (Debug Agent), and "Disparity" (Analytics Agent). Implementation is the next step.
* **Homeostasis Protocol:** Design phase complete for the "Homeostasis Protocol" for self-tuning. Implementation is the next step.
* **User Interface, Security & Commercialization:** Administrator/End-User portals, Role-Based Access Control (RBAC), and the Agent Store/Monetization features are in the planning or conceptualization stages.
* **Specialization Protocol:**  The "Specialization Protocol" for automated agent specialization is still conceptual.
