## 1. High-Level Objective ##

To deploy, test, and characterize the capabilities of the "Make It So" Autonomous Agent Factory (MISO Factory).

## 2. Key Architectural Decisions & Features Implemented ##

* **High-Fidelity Genesis Protocol:**  A process was established to deploy the MISO factory from a base prompt, debugging and resolving cascading failures.
* **Atomic Full-File Deployment:** Transitioned from providing code snippets to delivering complete, replaceable files for more robust deployments.
* **Context-Aware Forensic Analysis:** Incorporated analysis of multiple files in context (main.js, package.json, Dockerfile) for more effective debugging.
* **Robust Error Handling:** The backend successfully catches errors from the Docker engine and reports agent status (failed, exited, running) accurately.
* **Single Agent Controller:**  The backend orchestrates the lifecycle of single agents, translating a user prompt into a Docker container.  Level 1-3 and 5 agents were successfully executed.

## 3. Final Code State ##

No final code state was included in the provided chat log. The conversation focused on debugging and testing, not on code modifications.

## 4. Unresolved Issues & Next Steps ##

* **Unreliable High-Complexity Agent Synthesis:** The AI struggles to generate valid Dockerfiles and supporting scripts for complex, multi-part agents, such as web servers (Level 4) or multi-step scripts (Level 5, although initially reported as successful, later diagnosed as a generative failure).
* **Missing UI Log Viewer:** The UI lacks a built-in log viewer, forcing the user to manually inspect container logs via the command line.
* **Lack of Multi-Agent Features:**  The current backend is a single-agent controller. Advanced features like multi-agent collaboration, competition, and judging are not implemented.  These features were discussed but not implemented as part of this deployment phase.
* **Limited Synthesis Engine Robustness:** The current system lacks error checking or self-correction mechanisms for generated Dockerfiles, leading to build failures for complex agents.  More sophisticated prompt engineering or retry mechanisms are needed.
