## 1. High-Level Objective ##

To resolve a login failure for the "MISO Mission Control" web application deployed on an AWS EC2 instance.

## 2. Key Architectural Decisions & Features Implemented ##

* **Ollama LLM Server Installation:** Installed directly from GitHub Releases URL using `wget` due to installer failures.
* **Frontend API Endpoint Correction:** Modified `mission-control-ui/src/api/apiClient.js` to point to the server's public IP.
* **Database Initialization Procedure:** Established a process of stopping containers, deleting the old database file, creating a blank database file using `touch miso_data.db`, and then restarting the application.
* **Authentication Configuration:** Added a `SECRET_KEY` environment variable to the `api` service in the `docker-compose.yml` file.
* **API Code Replacement:** Replaced the entire `miso_api/api_main.py` file with a known-good version.
* **Docker Compose File Update:** Provided a complete, working `docker-compose.yml` file.

## 3. Final Code State ##

```yaml
version: '3.8'

services:
  api:
    build: ./miso_api
    ports:
      - "8000:8000"
    environment:
      - SECRET_KEY=your_generated_secret_key_here
    volumes:
      - ./miso_data.db:/app/miso_data.db

  ui:
    build: ./mission-control-ui
    ports:
      - "5173:80"
```

```python
import os
# ... (rest of api_main.py code as provided in the final message of the log)
```


## 4. Unresolved Issues & Next Steps ##

* **API Container Startup Failure:** Despite configuration and code replacements, the API container still fails to start, preventing login. The root cause is determined to be within the application's Python source code, specifically within the `miso_api` directory.  The application developer needs to debug the project in a development environment to resolve the underlying startup issues.
* **Handoff to Developer:** The AI has exhausted its troubleshooting capabilities and recommends handing the issue off to the application's developer with the provided system status report and suggested next steps.
