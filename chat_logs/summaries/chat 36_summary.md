## 1. High-Level Objective ##

To debug and fix a JavaScript error preventing a mind map from rendering in a three-panel UI.

## 2. Key Architectural Decisions & Features Implemented ##

* **JavaScript IIFE for Encapsulation:** The entire `script.js` file was wrapped in an Immediately Invoked Function Expression (IIFE) to prevent global namespace collisions between application variables and external libraries (d3.js, markmap-lib).
* **Case-Insensitive Prefix Check:** The check for the `MARKMAP_DATA:` prefix was made case-insensitive using `toUpperCase()` to handle potential variations in server responses.
* **Whitespace Trimming:** Leading/trailing whitespace in the `blueprintContent` string is trimmed using `trim()` before checking for the prefix.

## 3. Final Code State ##

```javascript
/**
 * MISO Application Forge - Living Blueprint UI
 * script.js - v5.0 (Conflict Resolved)
 * Encapsulated in an IIFE to prevent global namespace collisions.
 */
(function () {
    'use strict'; 

    document.addEventListener('DOMContentLoaded', () => {
        // ... (rest of the code is the same as in the final version provided in the chat log) ...
    });

})();
```

## 4. Unresolved Issues & Next Steps ##

None. The final provided solution was deemed to have resolved the issue, and the chat log indicates "Mission complete."
