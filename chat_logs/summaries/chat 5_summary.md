## 1. High-Level Objective ##

To explore and define high-value business use cases suitable for McKinsey-level consulting, focusing on dynamic input, decision support, relevant technology stacks, and LLM prompt engineering to drive advanced system development across diverse industries.

## 2. Key Architectural Decisions & Features Implemented ##

* **Focus on Dynamic Input and Decision Support:** Shifted from static analysis to real-time, adaptive systems reacting to continuous data streams.
* **Expanded Engine Ecosystem:** Incorporated foundational engines like Data Orchestration (Kafka, API Gateways, Data Lakehouses), Advanced Computation (Optimization Solvers, Quantum Computing), Advanced HCI (VR/AR, Voice UI), and System Health (Observability/Monitoring) to enhance core use cases.
* **LLM-Driven Tool Building:**  Revised prompts to explicitly instruct LLMs to generate code for infrastructure, APIs, and tooling, enabling more autonomous system development.  
* **Detailed Technology Stacks:** Provided specific API links (open source and paid) for each use case, mapping technologies to core functionalities.
* **Industry-Specific Use Cases:**  Expanded to include detailed advertising/creative/media use cases.

## 3. Final Code State ##

No final, complete code blocks were present in the chat log. The focus was on high-level design and prompt engineering for LLM-driven development.

## 4. Unresolved Issues & Next Steps ##

* **LLM Limitations:** Acknowledged current LLM limitations in real-time grounding, deterministic computation, and security/privacy, emphasizing the need for hybrid systems with specialized engines and human oversight.
* **Autonomous Agent Development:** Highlighted the potential of LLMs as meta-creators and the emergence of multi-agent LLM systems for more complex, autonomous software engineering. This remains a future direction.
* **Practical Implementation and Validation:** The chat focused on conceptual design and prompt engineering.  Actual implementation, testing, and validation of these complex systems would be the next crucial step.
