## 1. High-Level Objective ##

To resolve a CI/CD pipeline failure and continue implementing the MISO project, specifically the SimulationAgent component of the "Foresight" planning loop.

## 2. Key Architectural Decisions & Features Implemented ##

* Created a `.dockerignore` file within `python_agent_runner` to exclude `ollama_data` from the Docker build context, resolving the "no space left on device" error in the CI/CD pipeline.
* Added the `easimon/maximize-build-space` GitHub Action to the workflow to free up disk space on the runner.
* Created the `SimulationAgent.py` file within `python_agent_runner/agents`, implementing the agent's basic functionality.

## 3. Final Code State ##

```python
import logging
import json
import ollama

logging.basicConfig(level=logging.INFO, format='%(asctime)s - %(name)s - %(levelname)s - %(message)s')

class SimulationAgent:
    """
    Analyzes a project plan to proactively identify potential failures,
    risks, and logical inconsistencies before execution.
    Inspired by the 'Foretell' proactive planning framework.
    """
    def __init__(self):
        self.logger = logging.getLogger(self.__class__.__name__)
        self.ollama_client = ollama.Client()
        self.logger.info("Simulation Agent (Foresight Protocol) initialized.")

    def run_simulation(self, plan):
        # ... (rest of the SimulationAgent code as shown in the chat log)
```

## 4. Unresolved Issues & Next Steps ##

* Commit the `SimulationAgent.py` file to the repository.
* Integrate the `SimulationAgent` into the `GenesisAgent` pipeline.
* Conduct a full project review, identify ambiguities, propose improvements, and ask clarifying questions regarding the MISO Manifest v50.0.  This includes reviewing new features like the "Funnel-Down Dialogue (Augmented)" process, "Helios Protocol," "Gauntlet Protocol," "RL's Razor,"  "Codex (Memento Case Bank),"  parallel planning, Guided Error Correction, and the SecurityAgent role.
