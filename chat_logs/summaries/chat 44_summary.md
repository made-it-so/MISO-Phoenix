## 1. High-Level Objective ##

To debug a CONNECTION_REFUSED error when attempting to connect to a FastAPI application deployed on AWS within a Docker environment.

## 2. Key Architectural Decisions & Features Implemented ##

* **Simplified Test Server:**  A minimal "hello world" FastAPI server was deployed to isolate network vs. code issues.
* **Relative Imports:**  Python imports were changed to relative paths to resolve import errors.
* **Repository Reset:** The project repository was recloned from GitHub to fix a corrupted file structure.
* **Frontend Configuration Fix:** The frontend's `apiClient.js` file was updated to point to the correct AWS server IP address (44.222.96.27) instead of localhost.
* **CORS Configuration:** CORS middleware was added to the FastAPI application to allow cross-origin requests from the frontend running on a different port.

## 3. Final Code State ##

```python
# miso_api/api_main.py
import uvicorn
from fastapi import FastAPI
from fastapi.middleware.cors import CORSMiddleware
from fastapi.staticfiles import StaticFiles
from .routers import genesis_router, auth_router
from .database import engine, SessionLocal
from .models import db_models
from .security import get_password_hash

db_models.Base.metadata.create_all(bind=engine)
app = FastAPI(title="MISO Core API")

@app.on_event("startup")
def startup_event():
    # ... (database initialization code omitted for brevity)

origins = [
    "http://localhost:5173",
    "http://44.222.96.27:5173",
]
app.add_middleware(
    CORSMiddleware,
    allow_origins=origins,
    allow_credentials=True,
    allow_methods=["*"],
    allow_headers=["*"],
)

app.mount("/generated_projects", StaticFiles(directory="generated_projects"), name="generated_projects")
app.include_router(auth_router.router)
app.include_router(genesis_router.router)
@app.get("/", tags=["Health Check"])
async def read_root():
    return {"status": "MISO Core API is operational."}
```

```javascript
// mission-control-ui/src/api/apiClient.js
import axios from 'axios';
const apiClient = axios.create({
  baseURL: 'http://44.222.96.27:8000',
});
// ... (interceptor code omitted for brevity)
export default apiClient;
```

```dockerfile
# Dockerfile.api
FROM python:3.11-slim
WORKDIR /app
COPY . .
RUN pip install --no-cache-dir -r requirements.txt
CMD ["python", "-m", "uvicorn", "miso_api.api_main:app", "--host", "0.0.0.0", "--port", "8000"]
```

## 4. Unresolved Issues & Next Steps ##

None. The connection issue was resolved, and the application was successfully deployed.
