## 1. High-Level Objective ##

To incrementally develop and deploy the MISO Code Engine, a system for automatically generating and deploying new agents and services within the MISO platform.

## 2. Key Architectural Decisions & Features Implemented ##

* **Shift to Immutable Infrastructure:** Moved from on-server builds to deploying pre-built container images to resolve resource exhaustion and build failures.
* **MISO Code Engine:** Implemented four core modules: "Prompt-to-Spec" Transformer, "Spec-to-Code" Generator, "QA & Test" Module, and "Genesis Script" Assembler.
* **Orchestrator Service:** Implemented base functionality including API endpoints for status, agent management, and the Code Engine.
* **Lightweight Frontend:** Replaced a resource-intensive React/Vite frontend with a simple Nginx proxy.
* **Python Agent Runner:** Deployed a dedicated service for running Python-based agents.
* **Inquisitor Protocol:** Implemented the foundational "Consciousness Loop" within the orchestrator for self-evolution missions.
* **Guardian Agent Logic:** Integrated ethical review capabilities into the orchestrator.
* **Replicator Agent Functionality:** Enabled through the completed MISO Code Engine, allowing on-demand generation of genesis scripts for new instances or agents.

## 3. Final Code State ##

No code was provided in the chat log.  The analysis refers to several scripts and services, but their content is not included.

## 4. Unresolved Issues & Next Steps ##

* **Specialization Protocol:** While the ability to design specialist agents was verified, the full protocol including data curation and model fine-tuning remains to be implemented.
* **Council of Protocols:**  Advanced Inquisitor toolkit features (McLaughlin Group Protocol, Colosseum Protocol) are not yet implemented.
* **User Interface, Security & Commercialization:** Administrator & End-User Portals, Role-Based Access Control (RBAC), Agent Store & Monetization all remain to be developed.
* **Daemon Watchdog Service:** A dedicated self-healing service for monitoring the Docker daemon is not implemented.
