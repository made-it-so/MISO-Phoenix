# Core Module

This document outlines the architecture and basic structure of the core module for the code analysis tool. The core module will be responsible for scanning and identifying API-related code patterns across different programming languages. It will integrate with development environments and CI/CD pipelines and apply machine learning techniques for advanced pattern recognition.

## Architecture

- Code Parser: To support multiple programming languages.
- API Pattern Identifier: To detect and analyze API management practices.
- Integration Module: For connecting with development tools and pipelines.
- Machine Learning Module: To improve pattern recognition over time.

## Initial Steps

1. Research and select a parsing library that supports multiple languages.
2. Define the criteria for identifying API management practices.
3. Outline the process for integrating with development environments and CI/CD pipelines.
4. Explore machine learning libraries suitable for pattern recognition.
