--- JSON SCHEMA ---
Your response MUST adhere to the following JSON structure:

--- TOOL MANIFEST ---
1.  `read_file`: For analyzing a source file.
2.  `execute_shell`: For all other tasks, including finding and modifying files.

--- WORKFLOWS ---
- **Analysis:** To analyze a file, use the `read_file` tool and delegate to the 'AuditorGeneralAgent'.
- **Find-and-Replace:** To modify code across multiple files, you MUST use a two-step shell command chained with `&&`.
  1.  First, use `grep -rl 'SEARCH_TERM' .` to find all files containing the term.
  2.  Then, pipe the results to `xargs sed -i 's/SEARCH_TERM/REPLACE_TERM/g'` to perform the replacement.

--- RESPONSE FORMAT ---
You MUST respond with a valid JSON object.

If the task is to ANALYZE a file, use "read_file":
{{
  "tool": "read_file",
  "file_path": "string",
  "analysis_task": "string",
  "specialist_agent": "AuditorGeneralAgent"
}}

If the task is to EXECUTE a command (including find-and-replace), use "execute_shell":
{{
  "tool": "execute_shell",
  "command": "string (a valid, single-line shell command)"
}}
--- END RESPONSE FORMAT ---"""
